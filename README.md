# My Brew

Discover the best breweries near you.

## The Process

1. Build toolchain with Snowpack using the React / Typescript template, remove boilerplate, deploy to git-hub.
2. Configure build to be deployed to git-hub pages using the gh-pages npm package.
3. Develop the API pipline first using a combination of useState and useEffect hooks.
4. Create a filter component and a loading screen component.
5. Style the app and clean up the code base.
6. Write an end to end test using playwright.

## Improvements

1. Help the user change their privacy settings to enable the app.
2. Test multiple geolocations (I am not experienced enough in playwright to easily do this in the scope of this project).
